What I did:

-In fund class renamed DonationAmout into TotalDonationAmount (a little more meaningful name)

-Renamed FundInfo and PetInfo classes into FundDetails and PetDetails, avoiding the "Info" termination

-Removed unnecesary comments, white spaces, empty rows, tabs, usings

-Simplified some code, for example by deleting the keyword "this" where it is not necesary

-Formatting code by using combination of hot keys ctrl+a+k+f
